#  Visualization for company stakeholders 
 * In this project i have used matplotlib library for visualising the data of company stake holders. The insights to the data were visualized by plotting bar graph,scatter plot,stacked bar chart.

### About the Dataset
* The dataset has details of 614 customers with 13 features:
Feature	Description
* Loan_ID	-------Unique Loan ID
* Gender----------	Male/Female
* Married	Applicant Married------------ (Y/N)
* Dependents-------------	Number of dependents
* Education---------------	Graduate/Under Graduate
* Self_Employed--------------	Self employed (Y/N)
* ApplicantIncome	---------------Income of the applicant

### Things done in project
* Checking the loan status : To see how many number of applicants loan was acceppted.
* To check the loan approval distribution across the  different types of region like : rural , semi-urban, urban.
* To check wheather higher education result in better loan  approval gurantee
* Next i had checked "Do Graduate people get approved a higher amount than their Non Graduate counterparts?",What's the average amount of loan approved for Graduate? for Non Graduate? Is there a huge difference between the two? 
* Next i had checked is there any correlation between applicants income and loan amount

### Learnings from the project
After completing this project, I had a better understanding of data visualization techniques. In this project, I had applied the following concepts:
* Bar plotting
* Scatter plotting
* Kernel Density plotting
* Subplot operations
* Axes modifications
